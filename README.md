# Forecasting analysis of beer&burger sales. 
A predictive analysis has been conducted for the company BforBirra, examining the correlation between beer&burger sales and weather forecasts. For the purpose of the analysis, open data on temperature, humidity, and precipitation has been employed.

## Overview 
The brewery provided a historical dataset on quantities sold, which was then integrated with open data pertaining to temperature, humidity, and precipitation to develop a sales forecast using machine learning forecasting models. 

## Dataset
The dataset given by the company encompasses the daily beer sales figures over a one-year temporal period. 

## Task description
Two distinct analyses have been conducted: the first examines the correlation between burger and beer sales and precipitation levels, while the second analyzes the correlation between burger and beer sales and temperature.
### 1.Data Exploration
Understanding the Structure: The dataset is explored to gain insights into its structure and to identify any necessary data preparation steps.

### 2. Data Preparation and Model Training
Forecasting Selection: The forecasting algorithm selected for the task is Prophet.

## Repository contents 
-	requirements.txt: Contains the necessary Python modules to be installed to run the code.

## Conclusion
As evident from the charts, burger sales have consistently risen over the past year, yet they continue to align with the weekly pattern observed in the bottom-right graph, showing higher sales during weekends.
No correlation is apparent between sales and temperature or precipitation.
